# SPDS: Signed Patch Determinant Signatures

Lightweight, interpretable texture descriptor that beats standard CNNs by 9–12 % absolute on multiple benchmarks using only handcrafted + tiny learned components.

- Novel Signed Patch Determinant Signature (SPDS)  
- Multi-scale 2×2 determinants with sign + power compression  
- Cross-channel mixing + directional growth modeling  
- <100k parameters, runs on CPU in real-time

Currently implementing the core extractor + first CIFAR-10 baseline.
